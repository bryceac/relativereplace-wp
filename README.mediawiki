'''Description:''' A plugin that allows user to use a short string to get the correct site address.

==Notes==

This plugin was created because I was annoyed with the fact that Wordpress was too heavily reliant on the URLs in the Wordpress database, making it so that I had to update records whenever my local Wordpress install got a different IP address.

While that problem is not completely remedied by this plugin, as all it does is replaces any instances of the following:

<pre>
{{site}}
</pre>

with whatever address is listed in the <span class="fontweight:bold">Site Address</span> field in Wordpress settings, it should make things a little easier for those either changing servers or, like me, perform backups on a local copy of Wordpress.

This plugin has been tested with Wordpress version 5.2.5. I do not know, nor can I guarantee it will work with anything release earlier or later than that.

===Installation===

To install this plugin, simply clone this repo or unzip it into the directory where plugins are stored (e.g. /Path/to/Wordpress/wp-content/plugins) and then activate it.

===Support===

While I would like to provide support for this plugin, I cannot do so, since I am very weak in the PHP language and this is my very first plugin, so you are on your own.
